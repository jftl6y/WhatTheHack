# Challenge 05 - Integration with Entra ID - Coach's Guide

[<Previous Solution](./Solution-03.md) - **[Home](./README.md)**

## Introduction

Th purpose of this hack is to demonstrate how to add an identity provider (Entra ID) to API Management. The students will:

- Add Entra ID to the Developer Portal.
- Demonstrate logging into the portal with their tenant credentials.

## Description

- The students can enable Entra ID by going into the Developer Portal management blade and clicking "Enable Azure AD"
- The students then should be able to go to the Developer Portal and log in with their tenant credentials.  
**_NOTE_** a Private browser window may be necessary to allow the user to enter their credentials and not have them automatically supplied by their other session.
- An advanced challenge is to enable identity via an App Registration. This is doing what the "Enable Azure AD" button is doing, and is helpful to demonstrate how they may integrate with another OAuth provider besides Entra ID.
