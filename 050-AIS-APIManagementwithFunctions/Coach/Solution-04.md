# Challenge 04 - Customizing and publishing the Developer Portal - Coach's Guide

[<Previous Solution](./Solution-03.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution>](./Solution-05.md)

## Introduction

The students will:

- Open and customize the Developer Portal
- Create a user and assign them to a group
- Log in as the user they created
- Publish the Product create in challenge 3
- Subscribe to the Product
- As the Administrator, approve the Subscription request in the management Portal
- As the user, test the APIs in their subscription and view/manage subscription keys

## Description

- The students are encouraged to be creative with their Developer Portal customization. Show them how to add graphics, change page layouts, etc. with the widgets.
- Show how they can interact with the portal by doing ctrl-click on the widgets
- The intent of not publishing the Product immediately is to show them the relationship between publishing a product and viewing it as a developer.
- It might be beneficial to pair squad-mates so that they can enact the personas of the developer user and administrator.
- If the student has trouble testing the APIs, remember to Enable CORS in the Developer Portal settings.
