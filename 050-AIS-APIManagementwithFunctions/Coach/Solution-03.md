# Challenge 03 - Create API Product - Coach's Guide

[<Previous Solution](./Solution-02.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution>](./Solution-04.md)

## Introduction

The students will bundle their imported APIs into a Product.

## Description

- Students will create a Product and will include their imported APIs in this product.
- Students should leave the Product unpublished at this step.
- SUGGESTION: have the student create the Product and add the APIs to the Product as a separate step. The UI for adding APIs on Product create is a little hard to use.
