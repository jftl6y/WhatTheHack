## Pre-requisites

- You should have completed Challenge 03

## Introduction

You would like to provide a place for your developers to discover, subscribe to and test their APIs.  

**_NOTE_** This challenge alternates between an administrator persona and a developer user persona. If you want, feel free to partner with a squad-mate to separate these roles and alternate back and forth.

## Description

### Scenario 01: Open and customize the Developer Portal

- Access the Developer Portal as an administrator from the Azure portal.
- Look at the existing site layout. Does this work for you? Do you like the look and feel?  Be creative and make changes - add pictures, branding, explore moving widgets around to customize the Developer Portal experience.
- Save your changes to the Developer Portal and publish your changes.

### Scenario 02: Create a User and Assign them to a group

- Create a user and assign them to the relevant group you created in the prior challenge.
- Login with this user to the Developer Portal **_NOTE_** You may want to open the Developer Portal in a Private browser tab to emulate a non-administrative user.
- Explore the Developer Portal. What do you see? Do you see the APIs you imported?

### Scenario 03: Publish your Product

- Publish the Product you created in the prior challenge. 
- Refresh the Developer Portal as your test user. Do you see your Product now?
- Subscribe to the Product. What happens now?

### Scenario 04: Approve the User's Subscription and test the APIs

- As the API Management administrator, approve the test user's subscription request.
- As the test user, refresh the Developer Portal. What has changed?  Try testing your APIs via the Developer Portal.

## Success Criteria

- Customize and publish the Developer Portal
- Create a user and that user can log into the portal
- The user can subscribe to a Product
- The user can test the APIs in the product via the Developer Portal after being approved.
