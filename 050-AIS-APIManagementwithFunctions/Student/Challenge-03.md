# Challenge 03 - Create API Product

[<Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./Challenge-04.md)

## Pre-requisites

- You should have completed Challenge 02

## Introduction

Now that you have imported some APIs into API Management, you want to package them into a Product to be consumed by your developers. In Azure API Management, a product contains one or more APIs, a usage quota, and the terms of use. After a product is published, developers can subscribe to the product and begin to use the product's APIs.

## Description

- Create a Product for the APIs you have imported which require a subscription and approval.
- Include a relevant name and description, and any Legal terms you wish to include.
- Add the APIs to this product you imported.
- Determine which Groups should be included in this product.
- Do NOT Publish your Product yet.

## Success Criteria

- You should have a Product created which contains the relevant APIs you wish to bundle.
- Groups assigned to the Product should include groups other than Administrators.

## Learning Resources

- [API Management - Create and Publish a Product](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-add-products?tabs=azure-portal)

## Advanced Challenges

- By default, Azure deploys the Administrators, Developers and Guest groups. What other groups might you create for your organization?
