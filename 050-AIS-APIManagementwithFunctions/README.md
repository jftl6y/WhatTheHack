# What The Hack - Azure Integration Services - API Management

## Introduction

The Azure Integration Services (AIS) Hack will provide you a deep dive experience in building a solution that seamlessly connect apps to services whether hosted on premises or in the cloud.  This hack will enable participants to solve common business scenarios our customers face when building AIS from ground-up, from deploying, configuring and securing API management and its backend services.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack, the participants will learn how to build an integration solution using API Management and Function Apps.  This involves the following:

1. Importing APIs into Azure API Management
1. Writing policies to secure and change the behavior of APIs in API Management
1. Package APIs as Products
1. Allow for API discovery with developers using the Developer Portal
1. Authenticate developers to the Developer Portal using Entra ID.
